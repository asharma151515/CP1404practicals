# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Books to Read

Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP5632, IT@JCU

By: Asmita Sharma

This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.  
`books.csv` is a data file for you to use.  
`books_backup.csv` is the same data, but not to be used... it is here as a backup to copy the data from if you need it
again.

Edit this README file, replacing the instructions (including this paragraph) with your own assignment details.  
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace
the `...` parts).

1. How long did the entire project (assignment 1) take you?

...Answer: I spend anywhere from 10 to 20 hours working on Assignment 1.That includes understanding 
the requirements, designing the program, coding the functionality, testing the program, and ensuring it
meets all the specified criteria. Also, essential to allocate enough time to comprehend the assignment,
plan the solution, implement it effectively, and test thoroughly to meet the assessment standards.

2. What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?

...Answer: 
1.Thorough Requirement Analysis: I will carefully analyze the assignment
requirements to ensure a clear understanding of the expected deliverables 
and functionalities before starting the implementation.
2.Early Task Breakdown: I intend to break down the assignment tasks 
into smaller, manageable units to work on them incrementally. 
That will help me focus on one aspect at a time and ensure steady progress.
3.Utilizing Advanced Concepts: Since Assignment 2 involves more advanced constructs 
like dictionaries, classes, and GUI, I will dedicate time to thoroughly understand 
these concepts and practice their implementation before integrating them into my program.
4.Effective Time Management: I will create a detailed timeline with milestones
for different stages of development, including research, design, coding, testing, and documentation.
This will help me allocate time efficiently and meet the submission deadline without last-minute rush.
5.Thorough Testing: I will focus on writing comprehensive test cases to cover different scenarios and
edge cases, ensuring the program functions correctly under various conditions.
