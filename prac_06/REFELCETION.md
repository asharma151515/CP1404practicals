Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.
Replace each ... with your meaningful answer.

What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

covered in the subject.

What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?
... I need to work on I need to work on improving my time management skills to allocate sufficient
time for studying, completing assignments, and practicing coding regularly.

What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
... I have been actively engaging with the subject material, practising exercise on daily base to get to know where is my error.

What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
... I need to stop delaying  and ensure that I start assignments and tasks well ahead of
time to avoid last-minute stress and rushed work.

What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
... One change I would like to suggest for this subject and our IT degree program is regarding the method of conducting coding exams. 
Currently, we are required to write code on paper during exams, which I find challenging and not very effective. In today digital world
where technology plays a crucial role in our daily lives, it seems outdated to assess coding skills using pen and paper.
As students, we all are used to using digital devices like laptops and smartphones to access information and perform tasks efficiently
In real-world scenarios, coding is done on computers where we can write, test, and debug code in computer effectively. 
Asking us to write code on paper during exams feels like being given a spoon to eat while being told to use our legs. 
It creates a disconnect between the practical coding skills we need to demonstrate and the assessment method being used.
Therefore, I believe it would be more beneficial for students if coding exams were conducted in a digital format, allowing 
us to write and execute code on a computer. This change would better reflect the actual coding practices in the industry and 
provide a more realistic evaluation of our coding abilities.
