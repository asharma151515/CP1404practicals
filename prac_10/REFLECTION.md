# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

... My estimate accuracy varied throughout the course. Initially, I tended to
underestimate the time required for practical tasks, often overlooking the complexity of certain concepts and the debugging process. 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As the course progressed, I became more familiar with the types of tasks and challenges involved in practicals. 
I started to reflect on my experiences and adjusted my estimates accordingly. By breaking tasks down into
smaller components and considering potential obstacles, my estimates became significantly more accurate.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned the importance of careful planning and the need to account for 
unexpected challenges. Making estimates forced me to think critically about the tasks 
at hand and helped me develop better time management skills. This practice also encouraged me
to be more realistic about my capabilities and the time required for each task.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Being reviewed by others student taught me the value of constructive criticism. 
I learned that feedback can provide new insights and highlight areas for improvement that I might not have noticed.
It also helped me appreciate different coding styles and best practices, ultimately enhancing my own coding skills.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Conducting code reviews improved my analytical skills and deepened my understanding of coding principles.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[https://github.com/asharma151515/CP1404practicals/pull/3#issuecomment-2227388990]()

### Explanation: The classmate say good only.


### Good Code Review 2

[https://github.com/asharma151515/CP1404practicals/pull/4#issuecomment-2225360819]()

### Explanation : In this review, my classmate provided valuable feedback by suggesting the addition
of a main function to encapsulate the program logic. This change would improve the overall 
structure and readability of the code, making it easier to follow. These also praised the 
well-structured CODE_TO_NAME dictionary, which effectively maps state codes to their full names.
Also, he noted that the code correctly checks if the uppercase state code exists in the
dictionary before accessing it, which is a crucial practice for preventing runtime errors. 
This review not only highlighted the strengths of the code but also encouraged best practices in coding structure.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

All good

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Reviewing form the classmate ,some them did review but mostly student still does not understand the reviewing is helpful
to improve the coding.
